Most of the code in here is (c) Copyrighted by Numerical Recipes Software.

You cannot use these selected few outside of NEMO because of interface
and code changes. Please be careful in using them; some routines have
a slightly different parameter sequence or type than their
corresponding NumRec version to make them work within the NEMO
environment. Also, some routines do not use the #define's, but instead
of control parameters.
