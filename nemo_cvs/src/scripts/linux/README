Linux distributions are notoriously different in their package
naming conventions, and makes it complicated to describe to
each other what you need to install NEMO.

If your package/version if not present, try and look at a
related or different version and try those. Or make a new
one, once you figured out what you needed.

Also note that often one package will trigger other packages,
so this list is the minimum you might need.


For Fedora:   yum list > packages.list
    	      yum install package_name
    	      rpm -qa
	      rpm -qf /usr/include/math.h

For Ubuntu:   
              apt-get install package_name
    	      dpkg -l
	      dpkg -S /usr/include/math.h
	      

In general you will need 1) and 2), and most likely 3) and 4).
When you use PGPLOT (recommended), X-windows development 
libraries are needed as well


1) C,C++,Fortran compiler
2) tcsh
3) cvs
   cvsutils
4) doxygen
