  * NEWS: minor change

  * NEWS: updates for 0.6.0

2009-09-12  Aleksey Cheusov <vle@gmx.net>

  * README: FreeBSD-6.2 /bin/sh is also tested

  * pipestatus: version -> 0.6.0

  * README: minor corrections, Solaris /bin/crap-sh is also supported

  * Makefile:
  shells += pdksh; minor fixes and improvements for targets "test" and "test_all"

  * Makefile: new target "test_all" for testing all available shells

  * pipestatus, selftest:
  $(()) is replaced with expr(1),
     $() -- with ``,
     for i -- with for i in "$@"
     As a result pipestatus supports even shitty Solaris /bin/sh (Gr-r-r-r-r)

  * pipestatus, selftest:
  Shell symbols "'`*\?&|; etc. are correctly escaped before eval'ed.
      As a result all these symbols are allowed in commands.
      For example,

        runpipe_base \
           awk 'BEGIN {print "+*<>(){}!&|"; exit 41}'  '|' \
           sed 's,[+*<>()],?,g' '|' \
           awk '{print $0 " --- " $0; exit 43}' '|' \
           awk "{print \"''\" \$0 \"'''\"; exit 44}" > "$tmp_fn"

      Regresion test for this case.

2008-05-04  Aleksey Cheusov <vle@gmx.net>

  * pipestatus: version -> 0.5.0

  * NEWS, README, pipestatus:
  0.5.0
      - 'check_status_re' and therefore 'runpipe_re' use 'grep -E'
        instead of 'grep' in order to simplify regexp that
        contains >=2 digit exit statuses.

        NOTE: Formally speaking this breaks backward compatibility.

      - If PIPESTATUS_VERBOSE variable is set to non-empty string, then
        check_status0 and check_status_re functions print an error
        message to stderr.
