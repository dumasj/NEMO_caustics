.TH PVCORR 1NEMO "1 June 2013"
.SH NAME
pvcorr \- PV map or XYV cube cross correlation search for spectral lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpvcorr\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using a template area/volume in a PV map or XYV cube, this template is shifted in the
velocity (V) direction and a cross correlation is computed as function of V.
Normally a strong known line will be selected as template, 
with a known rest frequency,
from which the other lines can then be identified. See also \fItabpeak(1NEMO)\fP
to find the peaks in the output from this program. Some renormalizations are
then needed, which in the presence of doppler shifts comes with some 
elaborate math. An example of this is given below for the low redshift
galaxy N253 in the case of some ALMA observations.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file - must be an PV map, with V along the Y-axis, or
a XYV cube, with V along the Z-axis. No default.
.TP
\fBclip=\fP
Clip value, above which to search for valid profiles in the template area defined between
rows/planes \fBv0\fP and \fBv1\fP (inclusive).
.TP
\fBv0=\fP
First row to search for the template, based on the \fBclip=\fP level. 
If none given, the program will
find the largest peak in the map/cube and decide on a reasonable
template. Rows are 1-based.
[-1]
.TP
\fBv1=\fP
Last row to search for template. [-1]
.TP
\fBvscale=\fP
Scale the velocity pixel size by this number to get more presentable
numbers in the output. Astronomical data sometimes appear in Hz or m/s.
For 2D maps this should be the Y coordinate, for 3D cubes the Z coordinate.
[Default: 1]
.TP
\fBrms=\fP
Experimental way to normalize the data to attempt to get more predictable
values for the correlation coefficients. Default not used.
.TP
\fBmode=\fP
Cross correlation mode.  1=true cross correllation (default) where the 
template map values are multiplied by the map values, i.e. intensity
weighted. 0=template map equally weighted, this gives emphasize to the
noisy lines to be searched for.  2=use the intensity weighted
mean velocity within the template to re-sample the map and sum
their emission along this curved line.   Default: 1
.TP
\fBregion=\fP
MIRIAD style region definition of the template area. ** Not implemented yet **
but expect something like region=polygon(10,10,40,15,40,25,10,20), all in
pixel coordinates.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Optional output filename. If used, for PV maps, the output is 4 columns of
X coordinate, V0,V1 and Vmean, all in 0-based pixel coordinates.   For
XYV maps (not implemented yet) there will be 3 planes: V0, V1 and Vmean resp.
Default: not used.
.SH EXAMPLES
First an uncalibrated (in velocity) pv1.tab is produced, this needs to be inspected 
where the strongest template line is located. The velocity axis can then be recomputed
such that the template line as the correct value, and all the others fall in place:

# y0min=6 y1max=20
# inspect where the tabpeak cutoff should be, 0.01 seems ok to get all and a bit more
tabpeak pv1.tab clip=0.01 > pv1.peak
# the reference line was fitted at -0.000066 (strongest line in pv1.peak) but has freq 100.07640 GHz

.SH CAVEATS
The current template is defined via the parameters \fB(clip,y0,y1)\fP and is far from ideal, hence the \fBout=\fP to
inspect which area/volume was computed.
Ideally a properly smoothed
version of a PV diagram will contain a better definition of the template. Another option is to find the peak in the map,
assuming this is related to a strong well known line, then walk down the spectrum until clip is reached. This would
alleviate one from having to supply a \fB(y0,y1)\fP pair.
.PP
Instead of the derived template shape, one could also define the offset by using a first moment. Or a gaussian fit.
This would require resampling the spectrum for the cross correlation and is more expensive, but possibly more accurate.
.PP
Can also use the template to define a v_mean, and resample this curvy line through PV and add up all the emission,
creating a spectrum. Not quite cross correllation, but since the code is all local... This is mode=2.
.PP
Finally, not all lines have a similar distribution in PV, this will diffuse or can even destroy the cross correlation. 
.PP
Output cross correlations still have dubious units
