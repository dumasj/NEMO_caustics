.TH CCDMOM 1NEMO "16 August 2013"
.SH NAME
ccdmom \- moment or accumulate along an axis of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdmom\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdmom\fP takes special moments (in position, or image intensity)
along an axis of an image/cube. 
It can optionally also accumulate along the selected axis.
.PP
For datacubes that need to produce velocity fields a number of
alternate options (gaussian fit, envelope tracing etc.) are available
via \fIpvtrace(1NEMO)\fP.
.PP
To get the intensity weighted shape of an object using the moments
of inertia, use \fIccdshape(1NEMO)\fP.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output image file. No default.
.TP
\fBaxis=\fP
Axis to take moment along (1=x 2=y 3=z)
[Default: \fB3\fP]
.TP
\fBmom=\fP
Moment to take [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3..]    
Compute either the sum (0), mean (1), dispersion (2), or peak location (3). Negative
numbers also have a special meaning. -1 computes the average intensity along the axis,
where -2 computes the dispersion around the mean value. -4 computes the clumping factor
per plane (only axis=3 supported now). -3 computes differentials along axis=3. 
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBkeep=t|f\fP
Boolean value if to keep the moment axis. If you keep the axis (instead
of compressing it), the values are replaced with the computed moment.
This can be useful if you want to subtract an cube/image with the
mean value along a certain axis. Only in this case (but see also
\fBcumulative=t\fP below) will the output image have the same
shape and dimension as the input image.
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBcumulative=t|f\fP
Boolean value if the values should accumulate instead along the selected axis. 
The \fBmom=\fP keyword is ignored, and the input and output datasets will
now have the same shape and dimension. 
[Default: \fBf\fP]
.TP
** \fBclip=\fP **
Exclude pixels with values in the range -clip to clip. Default: 0
.TP
** \fBrngmsk=t|f\fP **
Don't assign a 1st moment if the value results in a value outside the
range of the axis. This can easily happen for noisy data. Default: false.
.TP
\fBpeak=N\fP
For \fBmom=3\fP where it finds the peak, this allows you to find the N-th
peak instead of the first. This is achieved by visiting each peak, and masking
out all values downwards those peaks and then finding the next one.
.TP
\fBoper=\fP
If supplied, this is an extra operator supplied to the input file and output file,
to create the final output file. This is to prevent having to type two commands
such as
.nf
    ccdmom map0 tmp0 axis=1 mom=-1 keep=t
    ccdmath map0,tmp0 map1 %1-%2
.fi
instead of
.nf
    ccdmom map0 map1 axis=1 mom=-1 oper=-
.fi
.TP
\fBintegrate=t|f\fP
When using mom=0 the signal is summed along an axis, you can either just sum
the numbers (this used to be the old default), or integrate, ie. multiply
the sum by the cell-size along that axis. This is now the default, to make
it more consistent with the new units in \fIsnapgrid(1NEMO)\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
pvtrace(1NEMO), ccdsub(1NEMO), ccdrt(1NEMO), ccdshape(1NEMO), snapgrid(1NEMO), image(5NEMO)
.SH CAVEATS
Cannot compute straight moments, e.g. the 2nd moment along an axis, such
as e.g. \fIsnapgrid\fP can do. This 
program only computes user friendly numbers (sum, mean, dispersion)
and gives special meaning to negative values of mom= and axis=.
