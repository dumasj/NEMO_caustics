.TH TABDIST 1NEMO "18 November 2013"
.SH NAME
tabdist \- Compare distances between points in two tables, aka catalog matching
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtabdist\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given two tables, each containing specified column(s) that represent a set
of 1D, 2D or 3D points, it will
compute the nearest neigbor(s) from each point in the first table
to those from the second table. 
.PP
The output contains the same number of rows as the input number of
rows in the first dataset.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin1=\fP
First dataset, an ascii table. No default.
.TP
\fBin2=\fP
Second dataset, an ascii table. No default.
The tables do not need to be of the same length.
.TP
\fBcol1=\fP
Coordinate columns from 1st dataset. 1D, 2D and 3D are currently supported [1,2]
.TP
\fBcol2=\fP
Coordinate columns from 2nd dataset. 1D, 2D and 3D are currently supported [1,2]
.TP
\fBid1=\fP
Column in first dataset representing the ID name.
By default a number between 1 and number of sources is used. [0]
.TP
\fBid2=\fP
Column in second dataset representing the ID name [0]
.TP
\fBradec=t|f\fP
Should columns be interpreted as angular (usually RA/DEC)?
Only 2D comparisions are allowed here. Units must be radians at the moment.
See also \fItabdms(1NEMO)\fP.
Default: false
.SH EXAMPLES
The X,Y,Z coordinates of a 3 particle plummer sphere are perturbed by a small
amount and then compared to the original list. Thus they must match one on one:
.nf
% mkplummer - 3 | snapprint - x,y,z > tab11
% tabmath tab11 - '%1+rang(0,0.01),%2+rang(0,0.01),%3+rang(0,0.01)' > tab12
.fi

First a one dimensional comparison

.nf
% tabdist tab12 tab12 1 4
1  0.117073   1  0.122846     0.005773
2 -0.00899587 2 -0.0100997    0.00110383
3 -0.108077   3 -0.0964223    0.0116547
.fi
and then a full 3D case:
.nf
% tabdist tab12 tab12 1,2,3 4,5,6
1  0.117073  -0.097704 -0.299081   1  0.122846  -0.102288 -0.317648   0.0199768
2 -0.00899587 0.293374  0.12652    2 -0.0100997  0.281876  0.121453   0.0126134 
3 -0.108077  -0.19567   0.172561   3 -0.0964223 -0.203288  0.17993    0.0157534

.fi
Currently it will display the line number, the coordinate(s) in table1,
then the best matching line number and coordinates(s) from table2, and finally the distance.

.SH CAVEAT
Currently a brute force (quadratic in N) minimum distance is used.
