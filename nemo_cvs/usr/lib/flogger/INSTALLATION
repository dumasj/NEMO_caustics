Makefile is set up for SunOS 4.1.  If you want to use gcc, move 
the # comment characters in the makefile around appropriately.

If your machine has memmove() comment out the #define in sorting.h

If you don't have memcpy, comment back in:
  #define memcpy(to, from, n) bcopy(from, to, n)
or better yet upgrade your OS.

Type "make" or "make flogger.static"

If you want to install the sort algorithm library for real

  su root
  make install

Potential portability problems:

Shared libraries might work differently, or not at all, on your
machine.  Edit the makefile as necessary.

You might be missing mallinfo.  Some rewriting of the code will
be in order.  I'll put some ifdef's around this sooner or later.

If your machine doesn't use a traditional stack, the stack information
will be either plain wrong or it might cause segmentation faults.
But if you don't care about the flogger routine-- no big deal.  The
sort library itself should be quite portable, even if the test routine
isn't.

The typedefs for chunk4 and chunk8 are thoroughly questionable.  If
you have a more "natural" size on your machine, experiment.

If you are porting to a machine which doesn't care about alignment
very much, you can remove the extra alignment tests from merge
sort and quick sort for a marginal increase in sort speed under some 
circumstances.

memcpy() is used--if you have a better block-copy function at your
disposal, by all means plug it in.  Won't help much if you're only
sorting 4-byte things like ints or pointers, though, 'cause
merge_sort has special code for these anyway.  

send patches, bug fixes, plane tickets to pittsburgh, etc to mikey@ontek.com

I'm especially interested in portability of the merge_sort routine.
