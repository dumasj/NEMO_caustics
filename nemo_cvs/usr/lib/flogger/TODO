return -1 or something rather than calling assert() in many places

use "tag" sort when size of records is so large 
  that memcpy takes a significant amount of time.

better flow control in flogger; add some command line options
  for selecting which algorithms to test and which situations
  to present them with.

the check for stable sorting isn't decisive.

some of the file names exceed 14 characters

make the alignment checking easier to configure (merge and quick sorts)

maybe analyze increase in space/time complexity as array size grows
  and figure out O() empirically.

include file "sorting.h" is of questionable utility.

/usr/lib/lint/llib-lsort might be a nice touch for "make install"

should be more flexible about what size and complexity of thing to sort

maybe add a parallelizing sort

makefile and flogger arent't very portable

cc -pic is unnecessary when making libsort.a

add test for re-entrancy of sort
