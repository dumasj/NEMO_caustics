Density2 is a modification of Dehnen's density code. This version give an estimation
of the density for each particles, plus the distance of the kth neighbours. Moreover, an option allow
you to choose the density estimator between a plummer sphere or the one used
in hackdens method (20 times faster !!!).

It can be very usefull to use this program to display your NEMO snapshot using glnemo2.
Density2 program will add density plus the distance of the kth neighbours for each particles. 
These values will be used by glnemo to display a very nice and usefull rendering based on
the density of the particles.

Examples :
==========

mkconfig - 10000 shape=shell | density2 - - | glnemo2 - all

mkconfig - 10000 shape=cusp  | density2 - - | glnemo2 - all

mkplummer - 10000 | density2 - - | glnemo2 - all

# expential disk + gyrfalcON
mkexpdisk - 10000 | gyrfalcON - - kmax=6 step=0 logfile=/dev/null | density2 - - | glnemo2 - all play=t

Compilation :
=============

To compile, you need "cmake" tools.

cd build
cmake .
make
make install
