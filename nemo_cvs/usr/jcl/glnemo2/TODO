GLNEMO version 4 TODO

MEMORY USAGE IN GADGET:
-----------------------
read in temporary variable instead of a buffer P
and store value read directly in the respecting arrays.

Camera Path
------------
 use the viewer to save camera path coordinates. Flytru camera path using bezier splines.

Orbit displaying
-------------------
 Display orbits history. Specify a maximum number of orbits per particles (maxorb=100)
and a maximum number of time steps (maxorbt=100). If maxorbt has been reached,
then shift orbit array of 1 orbits. Put a new tab for orbit history in particles selection box.

Play :
--------
 Play forward/backward. Should be easy to implement with SnapshotList interface type: Use vector to store filename then go forward or backward on this vector. A bit more complicated with NEMO snapshots and multiple time steps. We should rewrite io_nemo to save in a vector the stream position....
 
Different data to display :
---------------------------
- gyrfalcON simulation
- ASCII
- (done) Gadget 
- (done) FTM, Cmayton Heller's file format 
- Ramses

Different way of input:
-----------------------
- (done) by single snapshot
- (done) by list of snapshot with range of particles (usefull for simulation with 
        variables number of particles in their components: stars,gas...)

     file01 0:1000,1200:1500
     file02 0:950,1210:1508
     ...
     ...
     file01 0:877,1240:1530
     
Data properties:
---------------
 component :
  - positions
  - velocities
 familly selected :
  - by range
  - by list of indexes
 type of data
  - gaz
  - particles
  - velocity vector
  - orbits
Options :
---------
 while loading snapshots, toggle options to enable loading while moving the scene
Object Form:
------------
- lock properties of the object fom one file to another (color and visibility)
Texure:
--------
- (done) rewrite texture loading protocole. Load textures only one time and store them in a vector.
