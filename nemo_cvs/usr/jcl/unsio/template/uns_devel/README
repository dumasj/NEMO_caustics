You need to install CMAKE utility
(Cf http://www.cmake.org/)


 1) put your main sources into "src" directory

 2) if you want to make a library, put files into lib/src

 3) to compile

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

binaries  will be located in "bin" directory

 4) to install
make install
(binaries will be copied in ${HOME}/local/unsio/bin )
