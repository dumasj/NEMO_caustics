1) REBOUND:  https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

To get it:
   git clone http://github.com/hannorein/rebound 
or
   wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/hannorein/rebound/tarball/master -O- | tar xvz

then

   cd rebound/examples/shearing_sheet
   make
   ./nbody


the compilation could fail if some libraries GL/glut.h cannot be found. In that case
grab that library from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ or use your package manager
to install it.  E.g on ubuntu 10.10 you will need freeglut3-dev, ie.
    dpkg -i freeglut3-dev
