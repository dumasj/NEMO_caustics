Provided here is the open-source caustics.c potential file for the
stellar dynamics toolbox NEMO. Included is also a script to combine
this potential with potential files that model other parts of the
galaxy. This script can be run with 'source add_caustics_call
potentialname'. The script merely find yours file in
$NEMO/src/orbit/potential/data, adds a function call, recompiles, and
links objects. Some alternative methods for combining potentials are
mentioned in the comments at the top of the add_caustics_call file.
Also included is an example potential to combine with caustics.c,
mpc.c, and an example of the expected result of combining,
mpc_caustics.c. This file combines the Miyamoto, Plummer, and
(assuming you combine properly) caustic potentials into one
mpc_caustics file. You may test that everything is working properly by
running the add_caustics_call script on mpc.c (not mpc_caustics.c),
and then running 'make -f Testfile all'.

You may find additional information on the caustic potential in either
the mpc documentation or in one of Pierre Sikivie's papers, such as the
one found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9902210
