Provided here are caustics.c, caustics.h, mpc.c, install_caustics, Testfile.

INSTALLATION:

To install the potential files into the NEMO environment
Copy the caustics.c file to the potential directory and compile the potential.

$ install_caustics

To test the caustic potential files.

$ make -f Testfile all

FILE DESCRIPTIONS:

caustics.c

Is the potential of the Caustic Ring Model of the Milky Way Halo of Pierre
Sikivie. This potential installed into the NEMO environment and may be called
as other NEMO potentials.

potname=caustics
________________________________________________________________________________

caustics.h is a header file containing the declaration and 
implementation of the caustic functions.
Inclusion of the caustic header file allows inline calls to
the caustic functions.

USAGE: apply_caustic_pot_double([position], [acceleration], [potential])

[postion] is a pointer to an array of x, y, z particle positions.
[acceleration] is a pointer to an array of ax, ay, az particle accelerations.
[potential] is a pointer to a variable defining the potential as a function of r

In the standard NEMO defintions these are *pos, *acc and *pot.
	
If the implementation is using floats this can be called as:
apply_caustic_pot_float([postion], [accerleration], [potential])

In standard usage the functions would be called as:
	apply_caustic_pot_double(*pos, *acc, *pot)
	apply_caustic_pot_float(*pos, *acc, *pot)
________________________________________________________________________________

mpc.c 

Is a combined potential using a Miyamoto, Plummer and caustics potential using
the caustics.h file to include the caustic potential. It is included as an 
example of usage and to test the installation.

________________________________________________________________________________

install_caustics

This is a shell script that installs the provided potentials. This should work
for standard NEMO configurations. More custom environments would need the 
potentials compiled manually.

________________________________________________________________________________

Testfile

This tests the values of the potentials for caustics.c and mpc.c to verify
the potentials are functioning in the environment.

________________________________________________________________________________

There is additional information on the caustic potential in the caustics 
documentation and in one of Pierre Sikivie's paper such
