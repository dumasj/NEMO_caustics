Provided here is the open-source mpc (Miyamoto Plummer Caustic)
potential program for the stellar dynamics toolbox NEMO, along with a
simple installation script and makefile test. To install the mpc
potential, first ensure that you have a working version of NEMO. Then
enter the nemo_caustics directory and run the install script with
'source mkcaustics'. To ensure that the installation was successful, it
is advised that you run the provided makefile test with
'make -f Testfile all'.

You may find additional information on the caustic potential in either
the mpc documentation or in one of Pierre Sikivie's papers, such as the
one found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9902210
