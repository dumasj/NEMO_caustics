# This is a script for easily combining the caustics potential with another NEMO potential.
# It was written with some assumptions about the form of the potential's code which match
# NEMO's default potentials list. It may not work for potentials not included with
# vanilla NEMO. If this script does not work, it is simple enough to link caustics.c with
# your potential. Just add calls to the apply_caustic_pot_* functions in a copy of the
# other potential's apply_caustic_pot_* functions, compile both c files as .o objects,
# combine them into one .so shared object, and shove it where NEMO can find it. The
# following is an example of the commands you would want for manual combination:
#  cp yourpotential.c yourpotential_caustics.c
#  gedit yourpotential_caustics.c (to add the function calls)
#  gcc -fPIC -c -I$NEMO -I$NEMOINC -I$NEMOINC/max -o yourpotential_caustics.o yourpotential_caustics.c
#  gcc -fPIC -c -o caustics.o caustics.c
#  gcc --shared -o yourpotential_caustics.so yourpotential_caustics.o caustics.o
#  cp yourpotential_caustics.so $NEMOOBJ/potential/
# Alternatively, you can #include the caustics.h header file and add a function call
# to caustics.h in your potential file.

#  case 2: they use #define potential_##TYPE (like in nfw3.c), use apply_caustic_pot_##TYPE
#  case 3: potential file #define's all but type declarations by #define'ing beginning and
#          end of double/float curley brackets in one place and calling definition twice.
#          This makes it impossible to add two different calls for the double/float
#          caustics function since everything is confined to that define. Move curley
#          brackets out of the define so that we can have our function call outside of the
#          define but also inside the brackets. Most paintful case.
